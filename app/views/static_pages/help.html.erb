		 		<h3>How is my caloric need calculated?</h3>
		 		<p>We use the harris benedict formula to calculate your BRM and maintenance caloric need. The formula is based on your age, height, weight, gender and activity level. The calculator is no absolute measurement and individuals will vary in their maintenance needs. You will need to make your own adjustments based on your weight loss or gain rate and caloric intake.</p>
		 	</li>
		 	<li> 
		 		<h3>What does activity level mean?</h3>
		 		<p>Activity level is needed to determine your daily caloric maintenance. The activity level is only an estimate. It's advised that you take a conservative approach first and see what happens. For example say you work out maybe once a week and are sedentary the rest of the time, then your maintenance will probably be much closer to the sedentary activity level than the 'lightly active' level. </p>

		 		<h3>How is my strength level calculated?</h3>
		 		<p>We use the Brzycki Formula to calculate your one-rep maximal lift strength. However this method will produce reasonably accurate estimations for repranges up to 10-reps per set. Above this reprange we will not apply the formula and you will not see the results on the chart.</p>
